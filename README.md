# VLAN Network Simulation with Inter-VLAN Routing

## Overview

This project simulates a segmented network using VLANs and implements inter-VLAN communication in Cisco Packet Tracer. It serves both as a personal learning project and part of a university networking module.

## Files Included

- `Final Assessment 2.pkz` — The Packet Tracer project file containing the complete network setup.
- `Assessment 2 - Emad Eltigani.pdf` — Project brief and requirements outline.

## Key Features

- Creation of multiple VLANs (VLAN 10, 20, 30)
- Proper port assignments to VLANs
- Configuration of access and trunk ports
- Inter-VLAN communication via router-on-a-stick setup
- Hostname configuration following standard naming conventions
- End-to-end connectivity verification with Ping

## Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** — for network design and simulation

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pkz` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the topology and configuration on all devices.
3. Observe communication between devices in different VLANs.
4. Use simulation mode to view packet flow and diagnose network behavior.
